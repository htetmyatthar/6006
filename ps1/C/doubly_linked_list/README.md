# Creating doubly linked-list
This is the section of creating doubly linked list. The below specification part is from the problem set of [MIT 6006 Spring 2020](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/resources/mit6_006s20_ps1-questions/).
Create a doubly linked list with the below specification.

## Specification
- Each node of this linked list maintains previous pointer and next pointer.
- This linked list should not maintain their length.
- The list is pointed by a pointer having head and tail of the list in it.

### Support of constant time operation O(1)
* insert_first(x), insert_last(x), delete_first(), delete_last()
* remove all nodes from x1 to x2 inclusive from L, return them as a new doubly linked list.
* splice anoter list L2 to the original list L1 after node x. After the splice operation, L1 should contain all items previously in either list, and L2 should be empty.
