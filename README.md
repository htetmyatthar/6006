# Introduction
This is my repository for playing with algorithms using the study materials or[ MIT 6006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020) Introduction to Algorithms course.

I will use mostly Python and Golang for this and occassionally C if I am really bored.
I am trying to learn Golang using this course as my guide.
# Testing
Everything will be tested.
